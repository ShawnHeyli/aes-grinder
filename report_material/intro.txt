The research project we had to work on was about the AES cryptographic protocol that is used in our everyday life to secure our communications and make them private.
AES is a quiet robust protocol which can t be broken in a resonnable time (the best complexity find in an full key-recovering attack is 2 126.0 for AES-128, 2 189.9 for AES-192 and 2 254.3 for AES-256).

Part of the reseach, called  Meet-In-The-Middle Attacks, is focused on reduced round protocols, that is the case in our paper. This paper "Automatic Search of Attacks on round-reduced AES and Applications" was produced by Charles Bouillaguet, Patrick Derbez, and Pierre-Alain Fouque and publised in 2012.

Our aim was to redevelop a software (initialy developped for the paper) that can find the possible solutions of AES, represented as an equation system. Our supervisor, Patrick Derbez, would like we did that in a most modern way and that the code could be reused later. He suggested us to developp it in C++ but the team would like to challenge themself and decided to develop the project with the Rust programming language (the only constraint was to have speedy language for all the matrix computations, our supervisor gave us his approval to use the programming language).

Literature Review
Papers in relation
For our projet, we just add to study the current paper, but as this paper is a bit dated, we decide to put it into relation with more recent papers published this 5 last years.
